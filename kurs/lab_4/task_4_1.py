Perfect numbers generator
Given the number, the task to return n perfect numbers.
In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors,
excluding the number itself. For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3 (excluding itself), and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6,
so 6 is a perfect number. More about perfect numbers read on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number.
Note: Use generator for that task
Input: 3
Output: 6, 28, 496
