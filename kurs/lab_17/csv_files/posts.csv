0,6,5,Any element of a tuple can be accessed in constant time.,Do you come here often? Ports are created with the built-in function open_port. Type classes first appeared in the Haskell programming language. Where are my pants? Haskell features a type system with type inference and lazy evaluation.,2011-09-12 09:58:42.303433,2000-08-10 20:00:47.905822
1,7,4,"The Galactic Empire is nearing completion of the Death Star, a space station with the power to destroy entire planets.",Tuples are containers for a fixed number of Erlang data types. Ports are used to communicate with the external world. He looked inquisitively at his keyboard and wrote another sentence. Haskell features a type system with type inference and lazy evaluation. Atoms are used within a program to denote distinguished values.,2008-01-08 07:29:22.416728,2011-07-27 01:08:52.325698
2,3,2,Make me a sandwich.,"Ports are created with the built-in function open_port. Do you come here often? Its main implementation is the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. He looked inquisitively at his keyboard and wrote another sentence. Messages can be sent to and received from ports, but these messages must obey the so-called ""port protocol.""",2001-06-15 09:49:16.983303,2022-06-02 06:13:20.354915
3,6,1,Atoms are used within a program to denote distinguished values.,"Atoms can contain any character if they are enclosed within single quotes and an escape convention exists which allows any character to be used within an atom. Its main implementation is the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. In 1989 the building was heavily damaged by fire, but it has since been restored. The Galactic Empire is nearing completion of the Death Star, a space station with the power to destroy entire planets. She spent her earliest years reading classic literature, and writing poetry.",2006-03-19 12:16:53.415435,2000-08-16 13:06:42.801971

He looked inquisitively at his keyboard and wrote another sentence. It is also a garbage-collected runtime system. The sequential subset of Erlang supports eager evaluation, single assignment, and dynamic typing. Any element of a tuple can be accessed in constant time.",2006-11-14 10:29:40.219407,2018-04-17 02:47:54.798070
